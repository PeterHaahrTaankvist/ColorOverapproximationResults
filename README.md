# Color Overapproximation Results
This is a repository containing the results for the ColorOverapproximation method for unfolding colored Petri nets. The method is developed as part of a 9th semester project at Aalborg University.

# Binaries
We use four binaries for the experiments:
The Safe Interval Overapproximation Method which can  be found at https://code.launchpad.net/~verifypn-cpn/verifypn/cfp_connected_vars revision 278
The Safe Overapproximation Method (Pointwise method) which can be found at https://code.launchpad.net/~verifypn-cpn/verifypn/cfp_point-wise revision 283
The Naive Method which can be found at https://code.launchpad.net/~verifypn-maintainers/verifypn/new-trunk revision 226
The MCC unfolder which can be found at https://github.com/dalzilio/mcc
